# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Engine with AI Opponent

Make a virtual environment using the command line if your editor doesn't already
give you the option to create one.
```Shell
$ cd tic-tac-toe/
$ python3 -m venv venv/
```

Use these commands to enter the virtual environment and using the "--editable" flag,
the Python interpreter will import the functions and classes as the project is
being worked on instead of having to rebuild and install the library every time
a change is made.
```Shell
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install --editable library/
```
